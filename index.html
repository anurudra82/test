    <h1>What is linux?</h1>
    <p>
      <big>
      LINUX stands for Lovable Intellect Not Using XP. Linux was developed by
      Linus Torvalds and named after him. Linux is an open-source and
      community-developed operating system for computers, servers, mainframes,
      mobile devices, and embedded devices. Linux receives requests from system
      programs and it relays them into computer hardware. Linux is flexible,
      reliable, secure and it has large community userâ€™s support. Linux is
      compatible with almost every possible file format and can run on a large
      number of devices.

      It's fair to say that Linux is a lot more intimidating to approach than
      Operating System's (OSs) such as Windows. Both variants have their own
      advantages and disadvantages. For example, Linux is considerably much more
      lightweight and you'd be surprised to know that there's a good chance
      you've used Linux in some form or another every day! Linux powers things
      such as: <br />â€¢ Websites that you visit. <br />â€¢ Car entertainmentcontrol
      panels. <br />â€¢ Point of Sale (PoS) systems such as checkout tills and
      registers in shops. <br />â€¢ Critical infrastructures such as traffic light
      controllers or industrial sensors.
